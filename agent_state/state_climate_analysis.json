Rainfall was \nbroadly close to average, though the western half of Scotland had a rather dry year .  It was a sunnier than \naverage year in many northern and western areas, although the Midlands, south -east England and East \nAnglia were duller than average . \nNotable extreme events during the year included wintry weather with snowfalls during January and \nFebruary , a hot spell in July leading to the issue of heat health warnings, heavy and persistent rain in \nnorthern England and southern Scotland in late October, and significant  disruption  caused by Storm Arwen \nin late November  for which a rare Red weather warning  was issued .  Five named storms affected the UK \nduring 20 21. \nThe provisional UK mean temperature for 20 21 was 9. 3 \u00b0C, which is 0.1 \u00b0C above average.   January was \nthe UK \u2019s coldest month since March 2013, and April saw the most air frosts for the UK for at least 60 years.   \nWhile January, April and May were notably cold,  most of the other months were warm er than average , \nespecially  September which was 1.8 \u00b0C above  average , with only the September of 2006 having been \nwarmer  in a series from 1884 .

On 21st July, 31.3 \u00b0 C was recorded at Castlederg, County Tyrone, a new all-time record for Northern \nIreland.   The lowest temperature of the year, -23.0 \u00b0C at Braemar (Aberdeenshire) on February 11th, was \nthe lowest recorded anywhere in the UK since 1995 . \nRainfall was variable through the year, with the overall annual figures unremarkable .  May was the  UK\u2019s  \nwettest month relative to average, and January was also very wet over much of England.   However, April \nand November were dry - April especially so, with only 28% of normal rainfall for the UK overall - and June \nwas also rather dry with the exception of the south -east.  The provisional UK rainfall total for 20 21 was 1077 \nmm, which is 93% of the 19 91-2020 average .  Much of western Scotland had less than 80% of average \nrainfall for the year, with other areas closer to average . \nApril was an exceptionally  sunny month for the second year in a row  and for the UK provis ionally the \nsunniest April on record in a series from 1919.  However, May, August and December were much duller \nthan average  with only 27.6 hours for the UK for December overall .

The year began with Storm Henk on the \n2nd of January, bringing damaging wind and rain to central and southern parts of the UK. The \n2023/2024 storm season was a busy one, culminating in Storm Lilian in August, the first time \u2018L\u2019 has \nbeen reached in a single storm season since the naming system beg an in 2015. The end of January \nsaw the first red warning of the year as Storm Isha, the strongest wind storm since Storm Eunice in \n2022, swept across the country. Exceptionally wet weather mid -May led to significant  disruption for \nparts of England, southern and eastern Scotland, and north Wales, with some stations recording \ntheir wettest May day on record. In September, a series of low pressure systems brought heavy \nrainfall to the Midlands, resulting in extensive fl ooding and the wettest calendar month on record for \nOxfordshire and Bedfordshire.  In late November, Storm Bert brought heavy rain to south Wales and \nparts of southwest and southern England, with 150mm or more of rain falling in the wettest areas. \nThe begin ning of December saw the second red warning for wind of 2024 as Storm Darragh brought \nwidespread strong winds and heavy rain to the UK. The year closed with unsettled weather as slow -\nmoving bands of rain crossed northern England and Scotland.  \nThe UK annual mean temperature was 9.78\u00b0C, 0.64\u00b0C above the 1991 -2020 long -term average and \nthe fourth warmest year for the UK in the series from 1884. The minimum temperature in particular \nwas above average, with a mean of 6.32\u00b0C, 0.79\u00b0C above average for  the UK and the equal -\nwarmest annual minimum temperature on record. Eight of the 12 months of the year saw \ntemperatures above average, with February the second warmest on record, May the warmest, and \nDecember the fifth warmest. Winter and Spring were both well above average for mean \ntemperatures, with Spring the warmest on record and Winter the fifth warmest. Summer and \nAutumn, however, saw temperatures near average.  In January, w arm temperatures and a localised \nFoehn effect led to a record -breaking 19.9\u00b0C recorded in Scotland, the highest January temperature \nin the UK.  \nDespite several periods of exceptional rainfall, overall rainfall for the UK was around average, with \nthe UK recording 1242.1mm of rainfall, 107% of the long -term average. Scotland and Northern \nIreland were slightly drier than average in 2024, but southern  England was much wetter, seeing \n121% of the long -term average rainfall for the region. Winter was the eighth wettest on record, Spring \nwas the sixth wettest, and April was the sixth wettest. Both February and September saw areas \nrecord more than 200% of t he average monthly rainfall. In September, some areas of central \nsouthern England saw more than 300% of the average rainfall , including Oxfordshire and \nBedfordshire. Sunshine was variable, but overall slightly below average, with the UK recording \n1274.4 hours of sunshine, 91% of the long -term average. January was a particularly sunny month: \nthe UK recorded 61 hours of sunshine (128% of the long -term average) , in large part due to a \nprolonged period of high pressure mid -month which brought sunny conditions.  \n \n \nUK statistical summary    \nMean temperature  Rainfall  Sunshine  \nThe provisional mean value  is 9.78\u00b0C, \nwhich is 0. 64\u00b0C above  the 1991 -2020 \naverage.

The most notable features were the record-\nbreaking temperatures in June, the exceptional heatwave in early September and run of named storms \nthrough the autumn and early winter. The year included cold snaps in mid-January, early March and late \nNovember to early December, by far the most impactful weather occurred in the second half of the year. \nTwo named storms in August were followed by a further six - from Agnes (late September) to Gerrit (late \nDecember). Several of these caused significant disruption from heavy rain and strong winds. The Met \nOffice issued two red rain warnings for storm Babet in the second half of October covering parts of eastern \nScotland, and this event caused severe and widespread flooding. Storm Ciaran in early November was \nexceptionally powerful but fortunately the strongest winds missed the UK to the south. The year ended on a \nturbulent note with a run of very unsettled, wet and windy weather. \nThe UK annual mean temperature was 9.97\u00b0C, 0.83\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 long term average and the \nsecond-warmest year for the UK in the series from 1884, behind 2022 (10.03\u00b0C).

Eight of the 12 months of the year were warmer than average; February, June, \nSeptember and December were particularly warm. June 2023 was the UK's warmest June on record by a \nwide margin, and the warmest month of the year - the last year this occurred being 1966. September 2023 \nwas the UK's equal-warmest September on record, including a run of seven consecutive days exceeding \n30\u00b0C somewhere in the UK - the longest such September run on record.
